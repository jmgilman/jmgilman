## About me

I’m a Site Reliability Engineer focused on building and running platforms that let developers ship quickly without sacrificing reliability. Most of my work lives at the intersection of:

- Kubernetes-based platforms (cloud + on-prem + homelab)
- GitOps, infra-as-code, and supply-chain security
- Observability, SLOs, and incident response
- Developer experience and internal tooling

Recently, I’ve been:

- Building a developer platform (**Catalyst Forge**) for a small team
- Experimenting with multi-cluster Kubernetes across cloud and homelab hardware
- Tightening CI/CD pipelines around Go, Python, and platform code
- Exploring the Cosmos SDK and blockchain infra from an SRE perspective

---

## What I do

- **Platform & SRE**
  - Design and operate Kubernetes clusters (dev/preprod/prod/preview)
  - Implement GitOps workflows (Argo CD / Flux) and environment promotion
  - Automate provisioning with Terraform / Pulumi and cloud-native tooling

- **Reliability & Observability**
  - Define and track SLOs and error budgets
  - Build observability stacks with Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, Grafana, etc.
  - Improve on-call quality via actionable alerts & runbooks

- **Developer Experience**
  - Build CLIs, templates, and golden paths for application teams
  - Standardize CI/CD (GitHub Actions, pipelines, policy-as-code)
  - Help teams adopt best practices without blocking delivery

- **Homelab & experimentation**
  - Run lab clusters on Minisforum/Proxmox/Talos and related hardware
  - Prototype ideas before they graduate to production platforms

---

## How I work

- **Design first:** I like to capture architecture, trade-offs, and failure modes before cementing them in code.
- **Bias toward automation:** Anything that’s done twice should probably become a script, a job, or a controller.
- **Operational empathy:** Tooling should make life better for the people on call, not worse.
- **Measured change:** Feature flags, progressive delivery, and clear rollback paths over “YOLO deploys”.
- **Clear communication:** I prefer detailed PRs, explicit docs, and transparent incident write-ups.

---

## Open source & community

I maintain and contribute to open source projects when I can, especially around:

- Developer tooling / CLIs
- Platform / infra patterns
- Homelab and experimentation setups

If you’re using any of my projects and run into issues or have ideas, opening an issue or PR is always welcome.

- **LinkedIn:** [linkedin.com/in/jmgilman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmgilman/)
- **Website:** [jmgilman.com](https://jmgilman.com)

I’m open to discussions about SRE / platform / infra roles, especially where a team needs help building a robust, developer-friendly platform.
